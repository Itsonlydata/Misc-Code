# Misc-Code
Miscellaneous code used in data work

This is a dump for some scripts that I've written to do various things, there's no real order or structure to it.
Directions for use are generally contained within the files themselves.

As this repository gets more complicated, I'll probably need to add more documentation. Currently it's pretty straightforward. Instructions for use, especially for the simple stuff, will be commented directly into the code.
